			<div id= "description-2">Alpha Rho Chi (APX) is the only national co-ed professional-social fraternity for architecture and the allied arts. Our chapters across the country have repeatedly earned the top award in the Greek fraternal systems for academic excellence. Our brotherhood-unique in its membership of men and women-strives to achieves fellowship and unity by perpetuating merit in studies and rigor in tradition. For us, there is no compromise, no uncertainty and no regret. For us, personal and collective strength is of the essence. Our numbers are small but sufficient. We are not an elitist organization. We believe in equality of gender and race. We strive to uphold standards and ethics of the design world and society in general. So if you have the inclination, a love of the arts, and a desire to succeed, seek us out and understand why this brotherhood is forever.</div>
